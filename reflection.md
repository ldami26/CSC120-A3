- I think i prefer Java over Python, it seems easier/more understandable to me, since I have some experience with C++ in the past.
- Both languages start differently, but you must print out the output for the user to receive.
- There are some cases where the mirroring didn't work, specifically changing am to are. Starting assignments early and following the four s's is definitely the way to go.
